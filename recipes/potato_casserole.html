        <h2>Description</h2>
        This easy, cheesy potato casserole is a crowd-pleasing side for just about any event.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable or chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>30 ounces frozen hash browns</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly butter or grease a 9x13 baking dish.</li>
            <li>Make the cheese sauce. In a medium pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add diced onions and cooke for 3 to 4 minutes until the onions turn translucent but not browned. Then add minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in flour and continue to cook for a minute or two until the flour turns a tan color. Slowly whisk in stock and bring sauce to a slight simmer. The sauce will thicken as it heats. Once the sauce is thick like gravy, stir in the cheddar cheese and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Combine the potatoes and the sauce. In a large bowl add the frozen hash browns and pour the sauce over the hash browns. Stir together well to combine and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Smooth the top.</li>
            <li>Bake the casserole. Place the casserole in the center rack of your oven and bake for 45 minutes at 400°F. Then turn on the broiler and broil for 5 minutes on high to crisp up the top of the casserole. If your casserole dish is not broiler-safe, then turn the oven up to 500°F and bake for 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve. Let the casserole cool slightly but serve while warm. Leftovers keep in the fridge for 5 days. Reheat in the microwave until warmed through.</li>
        </ol>
